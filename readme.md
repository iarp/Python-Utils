# IARP Python Utilities

A collection of utilities I use a lot throughout many projects.

I only work with Python 3.6 and 3.7 currently, as such these may not work in
previous versions. Most notably due to f-strings.

## Installation

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/iarp/Python-Utils.git#egg=iarp_utils

## Documentation

Every file and function is commented about what it does, how and when to use
it along with examples. Have a question? Open an issue.
